# Platformer Analysis

## Game 1: Super Mario Bros 3

### Ground Movement

In SMB3, ground movement was built to allow for variety.  Despite being on the NES, the game’s ground- based was not a constant walking speed.  Mario noticeably accelerates between his different speeds.  However, I would not describe it as “floaty”.  The acceleration is fast enough that the player still feels like they are well in control.  Mario also is able to accelerate to a run by holding the B-button.  Holding this long enough will play a sound and fill a power bar at the bottom of the screen. Once filled this bar can have a variety of effects, like enabling flight when a certain powerup is obtained, opening up secret areas, and other effects.  A big part of this game is built around the player finding ways to accelerate to their max run speed and keep it going to the end of the level.

### Jumping

SMB3’s jump allows for a great control.  The height of the jump can be controlled based on how long, the player holds the jump button.  Once the button is released, the gravity on Mario will increase and he will fall faster.  The faster Mario is moving horizontally, the higher he can jump.  Mario also keeps his horizontal momentum when he jumps as well.

### Level Design

One of the effects that movement has on the level design in SMB3 is that it causes the player to always be looking for flat areas where they can accelerate Mario to top speed.  Whenever the player finds one, it communicates to them that there is some opportunity for a shortcut or a secret area at the end of the path.  On the flipside, the game can also accommodate precise platforming due to the different speeds that Mario can move at.
